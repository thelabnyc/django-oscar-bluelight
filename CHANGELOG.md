## v0.8.0

-   Add Concept of System Offer Groups.
    -   System Offer Groups are standard offer groups, but are
        automatically created and are ensured to always exist. They
        can not, therefore, be created or deleted via the dashboard
        UI. They are lazy-created by referencing them in code using
        the
        `oscarbluelight.offer.groups.register_system_offer_group(slug='foo')`
        function. - Along with this functionality comes the addition of offer
        and group related signals which can be used to perform
        actions at specific points in time during offer group
        application. For example you could create a system offer
        group for offers which should be applied only after taxes
        have been calculated. Then you could use the
        `pre_offer_group_apply` signal to perform tax calculation on
        a basket directly before the offer group is applied.
