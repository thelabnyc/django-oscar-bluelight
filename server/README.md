This package contains enhancements and improvements to the built-in
offers and vouchers features in Django Oscar.

## Features

-   **Group Restricted Vouchers**: Bluelight adds the ability to restrict application of vouchers to a specific whitelist of groups (`django.contrib.auth.models.Group`). For example, you could create a voucher code that can only be applied by users who belong to the group _Customer Service Reps_.
-   **Compound Offer Conditions**: By default, Oscar only allows assigning a single condition to a promotional offer. Compound offer conditions allow you to create more complex logic around when an offer should be enabled. For example, you could create a compound condition specifying that a basket must contain at least 3 items _and_ have a total value greater than $50.
    -   Compound conditions can aggregate an unlimited number of child conditions together.
    -   Compound conditions can join their child conditions using either an _AND_ or an _OR_ conjunction.
    -   Very complex conditions requiring both _AND_ and _OR_ conjunctions can be modeled by creating multiple levels of compound conditions.
-   **Parent / Child Voucher Codes**: By default Oscar doesn't support bulk creation of voucher codes. Bluelight adds the ability to bulk create any number of child vouchers (with unique, automatically generated codes) for any standard (non-child) voucher. This can be useful when sending voucher codes to customer's through email, as it allows the creation of hundreds or thousands of non-sequential, one-time-use codes.
    -   Child codes can be added when creating a new voucher or after a voucher is created.
    -   More child codes can be generated for a voucher at any time.
    -   Child codes can be exported in CSV and JSON formats.
    -   Any time a parent voucher is edited (name changed, benefit altered, etc), all child codes are also updated to match.
    -   When a parent voucher is deleted, all children are also deleted.
    -   Once a voucher has child codes assigned to it, the parent voucher itself can not be applied by anyone.

## Roadmap

-   Make child code creation and updating more performant, possibly by (1) extracting some of the work into asynchronous Celery tasks and (2) better tracking of dirty model fields before saving.
-   Add ability to duplicate vouchers.
-   Add ability to add conditions to vouchers.

## Caveats

Bluelight currently works by forking four of Oscar's apps: offer,
voucher, dashboard.offers, and dashboard.vouchers. Currently there is no
way to use Bluelight if your application has already forked those
applications.

## Installation

Install [django-oscar-bluelight]{.title-ref}.:

```sh
pip install django-oscar-bluelight
```

Import Bluelight's settings into your projects `settings.py` file.

```py
from oscar.defaults import *
from oscarbluelight.defaults import *  # Needed so that Bluelight's views show up in the dashboard
```

Add Bluelight to your installed apps (replacing the equivalent Django
Oscar apps). The top-level `oscarbluelight` app must be defined before
the `oscar` app---if it isn't Django will not correctly find the
Bluelight's templates.

```py
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    ...
    # Bluelight. Must come before `django-oscar` so that template inheritance / overrides work correctly.
    'oscarbluelight',
    'django_pgviews',

    # django-oscar
    'oscar',
    'oscar.apps.analytics',
    'oscar.apps.checkout',
    'oscar.apps.address',
    'oscar.apps.shipping',
    'oscar.apps.catalogue',
    'oscar.apps.catalogue.reviews',
    'sandbox.partner',  # 'oscar.apps.partner',
    'sandbox.basket',  # 'oscar.apps.basket',
    'oscar.apps.payment',
    'oscarbluelight.offer',  # 'oscar.apps.offer',
    'oscar.apps.order',
    'oscar.apps.customer',
    'oscar.apps.search',
    'oscarbluelight.voucher',  # 'oscar.apps.voucher',
    'oscar.apps.wishlists',
    'oscar.apps.dashboard',
    'oscar.apps.dashboard.reports',
    'oscar.apps.dashboard.users',
    'oscar.apps.dashboard.orders',
    'oscar.apps.dashboard.catalogue',
    'oscarbluelight.dashboard.offers',  # 'oscar.apps.dashboard.offers',
    'oscar.apps.dashboard.partners',
    'oscar.apps.dashboard.pages',
    'oscar.apps.dashboard.ranges',
    'oscar.apps.dashboard.reviews',
    'oscarbluelight.dashboard.vouchers',  # 'oscar.apps.dashboard.vouchers',
    'oscar.apps.dashboard.communications',
    'oscar.apps.dashboard.shipping',
    ...
]
```

Fork the basket application in your project and add
`BluelightBasketMixin` as a parent class of the `Line` model.

```py
from oscar.apps.basket.abstract_models import AbstractLine
from oscarbluelight.mixins import BluelightBasketLineMixin

class Line(BluelightBasketLineMixin, AbstractLine):
    pass

from oscar.apps.basket.models import *  # noqa
```

## Usage

After installation, the new functionality will show up in the Oscar
dashboard under the Offers menu.

### 0.8.0

-   Add Concept of System Offer Groups.
    -   System Offer Groups are standard offer groups, but are
        automatically created and are ensured to always exist. They
        can not, therefore, be created or deleted via the dashboard
        UI. They are lazy-created by referencing them in code using
        the
        `oscarbluelight.offer.groups.register_system_offer_group(slug='foo')`
        function. - Along with this functionality comes the addition of offer
        and group related signals which can be used to perform
        actions at specific points in time during offer group
        application. For example you could create a system offer
        group for offers which should be applied only after taxes
        have been calculated. Then you could use the
        `pre_offer_group_apply` signal to perform tax calculation on
        a basket directly before the offer group is applied.

### 0.7.1

-   Fix exception in dashboard when adding compound conditions

### 0.7.0

-   Fix bug related to conditions consuming basket lines when the
    condition range differed from the benefit range.

    in better error reporting of invalid but difficult to enforce data.
-   Start to rebuild OfferGroup dashboard view as a React application.
    -   Currently just recreates existing functionality using React
        and an API endpoint. - Next release will include drag-and-drop priority sorting of
        offers, vouchers, and offer groups.

### 0.6.1

    -   Fix issue with Voucher ordering when doing a
        select_for_update. - Fix Oscar 1.5 issue with conditionaloffer_set vs offers
        related name. - Fix Oscar 1.5 issue with basket.Line.line_tax. - Upgrade sandbox to Oscar 1.5.
-   Add new field to ConditionalOffer: short_name
-   Make OfferApplications ordered

### 0.6.0

-   Add concept of Offer groups.
    -   This makes it possible to create promotions which overlap on

        `Condition.consume_items` method. - Adds migration to change all row's proxy_class from
        `oscar.apps.offer.FOOBAR` to `oscarbluelight.offer.FOOBAR`.
-   Change behavior of `FixedPriceBenefit` to be more logical.
    -   Uses the benefit's assigned range instead of the
        condition's range. - Respects the `max_affected_items` setting.
-   Improved dashboard form validation using polymorphic `_clean`
    methods on benefits and conditions.
-   Disallow deleting a range when a benefit or a condition depends on
    it.

    no offers linked to it.

### 0.4.0

-   Dashboard:
    -   Separate vouchers form offers in benefits and conditions
